\chapter{Evaluation}

Evaluation of the developed technology was conducted in the form of an experiment.
The motivation behind this choice was the desire to assess the extent to which all stated objectives were achieved.
Although, the intuitive choice was to employ an approach of automated software testing, not all objectives could be effectively assessed in that manner.
Domain discoverability, in particular, is better suited to evalutaion by opinion because of its subjective nature. 
Also, given rather uncommon software development technique of code generation, as well as the intricate dependencies between the generated code and source code, it was challenging to develop automated tests for the assessment of the other two objectives, namely, model consistency and evolvability. 
Therefore we use the experiment as the sole means of evaluation.

\n

The focus group of the experiment was comprised of 7 software engineers working on several commercial projects built with TG at their core.
The experiment had been conducted over a period of one week, at the end of which every participant was asked to fill out a questionnaire.
Each individual was asked to agree/disagree with a handful of statements and optionally provide additional comments.

\n

Despite the fact that the actual duration was shorter than originally planned, most answers convey enough information with only a few where several respondents share the opinion that more time is required. 
What follows is a display of responses, accompanied by selected comments that contributed most valuable insight.

\section{Discoverability of the domain model}
Figure \ref{fig:q1} shows that all respondents recognize the improvements in domain discoverability.
Several comments show an appreciation for the generated javadoc for entity properties, implying that it leads to an increase in the development pace.
\mychart{5}{2}{0}{0}{0}{Question 1: Domain discoverability}{The information provided by meta-models in the form of javadoc combined with the IDEâ€™s code auto-completion feature made domain discoverability more efficient.}{q1}

\section{Reliability}

\mychart{4}{3}{0}{0}{0}{Question 4: Reliability}{Usage of the generated meta-models proved to be a reliable way of referencing properties of an entity, i.e., there were no occurrences of runtime errors.}{q4}

\section{Evolvability}

\mychart{4}{2}{1}{0}{0}{Question 5: Evolvability}{Evolvability of a system against modifications to the conceptual model increased due to compile-time validation in places where the generated meta-models were referenced.}{q5}

\mychart{5}{2}{0}{0}{0}{Question 6: Performance}{Impact of the meta-model generation process on performance of the IDE during compilation has been insignificant to the development process.}{q6}

\section{Correctness of the generation mechanism}
